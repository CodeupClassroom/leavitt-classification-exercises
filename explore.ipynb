    "# Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning - Acquisition - Preparation - **Exploratory Analysis** - Modeling - Product Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce exploratory data analysis, called EDA, which is the \"explore\" stage in the DS Pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals of EDA\n",
    "\n",
    "We explore the interactions of the attributes and target variable to help discover drivers of our target variable and redundant or interdependent attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Discover features that are driving the outcome (target). (Number 1 reason to explore)\n",
    "2. Learn the vast majority of our takeaways and interesting stories from the data. \n",
    "3. Discover if we need to drop features, if we need to handle missing values, or if there's value to combining features. \n",
    "\n",
    "## EDA Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Hypothesize: Form and document your initial hypotheses about how the predictors (independent variables, features, or attributes) interact with the target (y-value or dependent variable). You can do this in the form of questions in a natural language (as opposed to \"statistical\" language). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Visualize: use visualization techniques to identify drivers. When a visualization needs to be followed up with a statistical test, do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test your hypotheses when visualization isn't immediately clear. Use the appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, correlation, chi-square)\n",
    "\n",
    "**General Recipe**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Univariate Stats: descriptive stats, frequencies, histograms. This is often done during prep prior to splitting into train/validate/test, but if it is not, then it should be done first here. Why? Outliers. Running tests that assume normalcy. Scale of each variable. General \"getting to know\" your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Univariate means a single variable, so we'll look at `.value_counts()` and histograms.\n",
    "    - Explore the target variable itself. What is the distribution of values?  \n",
    "    - Explore the categorical and qualitative variables. \n",
    "    - Explore the numeric variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Bivariate Stats. Bivariate means two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Plot the interactions of each variable with the target. Document your takeaways.     \n",
    "    - Explore interation of independent variables using viz and/or hypothesis testing to address interdependence. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multivariate Stats (more than 2 variables): Ask additional questions of the data, such as how subgroups compare to each-other and to the overall population. Answer questions using visualizations and/or hypothesis testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - use color to represent a discrete variable and then choose a chart style based on the data types of other two variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Statistical Tests: If the visualizations are not crystal clear, it's important to conduct hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - With numeric to numeric, test for correlation with Pearson's R for linear and Spearman's R for non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For numeric to categorical, compare the means of two populations or a subgroup to the population using a [t-test](https://ds.codeup.com/stats/compare-means/), if your samples are normaly(ish) distributed but have different variances (as determined by calling `.var()` on each column/Series, [ANOVA](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html) to compare means from more than 2 groups, or a [Mann-Whitney u-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html) if the data does not match the [assumptions of a t-test](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073115/what-assumptions-are-made-when-conducting-ttest.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - With categorical to categorical variables, use $\\chi^2$, [chi-squared test](https://ds.codeup.com/stats/compare-group-membership/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standing Orders** for Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document** your initial questions or assumptions. Write them down (in your README or notebook) so they are concrete and not in your head.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document** your takeaways after each visualization. Even if your takeaway is, \"there is nothing interesting between *var1* and *target*\". \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document** your answer to each question. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When you run statistical tests to answer your questions, **Document** your null and alternative hypothesis, the test you run, the test results, and your conclusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document** your takeaways, in case that wasn't clear. It is a huge component of your final deliverable/analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document** your action plan.  What are your next steps and/or new questions based on what you have learned? I recommend documenting, continuing through all of your questions, and then going back and taking action only after you have answered your initial questions. "
